Codes for PS3 - BLES00444 (possibly other regions too)

I'm probably not going to search for any more items, as they are really easy to find with NetCheat PS3. 
I will at least label all of the missing item's I have here. All you need to do is replace the item #
Just an FYI, to get netcheat working properly, I used Target Manager, and the PS3 debugger. You also have to decrypt your game eboot. 
I couldn't figure out how to put score pieces in the menu, but I found the item numbers (5E,5F,60,61,62.......) 
Hopefully someone smarter than me can figure out how to give yourself those. 
You can enter these directly into NetCheat PS3, or download the NCM file i've  uploaded.
For Quick Level, please follow these instructions if you plan to level normal after quick leveling.

For example, if you just want to quick level you could just enter the XP and Quick level as 0000B39A. Each time you set it to that, you will get a level up. The problem arises once you want to begin to level like normal. If you went to level 50 like this, then you'll have an issue going forward. You will level like you are from 16, which will be much faster than it should. To fix this, you can level like this.

Example: Once you get to level 16, you need 0000b39B exp to level. If you set your quicklevel & XP to the integer before it, you will level as you should. So really, you should find the max level you want to be at and find the natural XP amount to get there, then set your QL to one before it. After that you just keep fighting until you are at the target level. If you don't know the amount of XP, then you can do this: Once you level to 16 from 17, with the integer we just used (0000B39A), you can look at your max XP, and to next level XP. Add those together, and you will get 0000DDCC. Set your QL and XP to one before that to have the next level be proper. Keep doing that until you are at the level you want.
           XP and Quicklevel numbers to go in cheats below 
           
 This is the max XP before you go to the next level. Use these integers for both XP & QL below, to mimic how to game
would level your character at a certain level. Really only the QL(quick level) matters, the XP is just to make it look the same as 
the game would. If you need to get to level 16, just use the level 16 numbers, until you get 
to 16.

And so on... If you don't care about leveling properly this doesn't matter. If you use a number too high, you'll level slow. If you use a
number too low, you'll level quick etc. I like to pick the level I want to go to, then enter that after each battle. Battle that many 
times, then once you hit the level you want, don't enter the code again. You'll be at the correct amount to continue leveling like 
normal.

HOW TO GO TO HIGHER LEVELS

If you use the level 40 Quick Level number, you will get the max XP you would have at level  40, before hitting 41.  Just enter that code, 
level up and repeat until you get to level 41. At that point, you will level up like normal. If you wanted wanted to level  up again, to
42, you would have to find out the max XP & next level, as I don't have it listed. Here's how.

Once you level up to 41, look at your XP, and Next level. 

41
Exp: 1282910
Next LVL: 124620

If you add up those numbers, then substract by one, you will get the number right before you level for that level. In this case its

1282910 + 124620 = 1,407,530

Now if you use this number you'd be at the right XP for 41, but because we want to level first and gain those nice stat points, we 
subtract by one, and then set it.

1,407,530 - 1 = 1,407,529

Now let's convert this number to Hex = 00157A29

Now use NetCheat to set the QuickLevel and XP to 1,407,530 (in this example I'll use Polka)

So the cheat to get to level 41 XP for Polka would look like this

0 008299B4 00157A2A
0 00829BF4 00157A2A

This will set your next level XP to 1, and make it so once you do level, you'll be in the correct spot to level to 42. The actual XP
isn't really significant, but to have the correct amount listed, just keep it the same as the QL. If you are doing things right, the QL
and XP should always be the same. 

A quick way to find the next XP level is to just add them together like above, without substracting the 1. Then push that to your character.
Once you've done that, add the XP and Next Level again for the next. Just remember once you get to the number you want to subtract one,
so that you are 1 point before the lvl  you want. 

TLDR; To find the XP to quick level properly, you need to add your total XP & next level, then subtract it by 1. The only caveat is
You have to know that number before you can level. You can probably look at characters on Youtube or Google as well to get the number.
